    <h3>Project intro</h3>
    <p>A team of ambitious and passionate folks have assembled and they're creating a new product called Startrly. Startrly is a new and unique solution for some problem, and it's going to disrupt some industry. They've hired you to make a new front-page for their product's website. They have a good idea for what they want in their front page in terms of layout and content, so they've provided wireframes and the HTML for the front page. However, in terms of literal styles, colors, and visual design choices, they've left that freedom to you.</p>
    <h3>Task:</h3>
    <p>Using CSS, construct the layout of the site according to the following wireframe attached to the project</p>

    <p>Your company has been contracted to build a booking system for a small hotel. This system will be used by employees working at the front desk, and will not be available to the general public.This system will have two parts: a user interface that runs in the terminal, and a module full of business logic, classes and methods that keep track of which rooms are reserved when. Your job is to implement the business logic only. You do not need to build a CLI for this project.Instead, you will use tests to verify your part of the system works as intended.</p>
